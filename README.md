# BioHackEU_MolViewSPec
In this project, we are going to convert [iCn3D](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d) URL into [molstar](https://github.com/molstar/molstar) Mole View Stories. One example iCn3D URL is "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/full_3.45.3.html?mmdbafid=1KQ2&date=20251103&v=3.45.3&command=load mmdbaf1 1KQ2 | parameters &mmdbafid=1KQ2; defined sets; select sets !A; color F00; select sets !B; color 00FF7F; select sets !H; color 00F; select sets !I; color FF69B4; select sets !K; color FF8C00; select sets !M; color 0FF; style proteins sphere|||pos:0.000,0.000,204.9|dir:0.000,0.000,-1.000|up:0.000,1.000,0.000|fov:20.00". 

To test the deposited HTML file index.html, you can use npm to set up a static-server "npm install static-server" and launch the file with the command "static-server -i index.html -o".

The help page about Mol View Spec is at https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec-docs/. Some examples are available at https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec/.
